## Peppery Fried Rice

> 2 cups cooked white rice
> 1 onion, finely chopped
> 1-2 carrots, finely chopped
> 1-2 celery stalks, finely chopped
> 1 thumb of ginger
> 4 cloves of garlice
> 1 cup of broccoli florets (optional)
> 1 bunch of green onions
> 1/4 cub low sodium soy sauce
> 1/4 cup rice vinegar
> Sichuan peppercorns (mixed with green peppercorns if you want)
> Long pepper
> Toasted sesame oil
> Canola or other neutral oil

Chop the onion, carrot, and celery. Heat a pan, then add some neutral oil, and then add the onion when the oil is hot.  Pulse the garlice and ginger in a mini food processor, 
or dice them, microplane them, or otherwize pulverize them.  After 3-5 minutes, when the onion begins to brown, add the carrot and celery (if you have them, if not it's fine).  After about two minutes, add the ginger and garlic as well as the Sichuan, green, and long pepper.  Once you smell the garlic cooking, push everything to the side 
of the pan and toss in the broccoli.  After about two minutes, once the broccoli turns brilliant green, remove the broccoli and set it aside in a small bowl.  Add some sesame oil 
and then the rice, followed by equal parts soy sauce and rice vinegar.
