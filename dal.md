## Instant Pot Dal Makhani

>1 cup whole black lentils  
>1/4 cup red kidney beans (optional) 
>1 thumb of fresh ginger  
>6+ cloves garlic  
>1 14 oz. crushed tomatoes  
>Salt to taste  
>1 stick of butter  
>1/2 cup whipping cream (optional)
>1 T garam masala  
>1 T cumin  
>1 T coriander  
>1/2 t turmeric  
>2â€“3 dried chiles  

Rinse and drain the lentils and kidney beans.  Pulse the tomatoes with an emersion blender.

Put the lentils, kidney beans, ginger, and garlic into the instant pot and cover with about one quart of water.  Cook on high pressure for 12 minutes.  Release the pressure manually, and then set the Instant Pot to the highest slow cook setting.
 
Add the spices.  Pulse the tomatoes with an emersion blender, and then add those as well.  Drop the stick of butter into the pot, and the cream if you are using it (if you are using cream, you can reduce the butter).  Leave on the slow cook setting for at least 30 minutes before serving (you can leave it on slow cook for hours if you want).
