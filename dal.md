_I'm not sure when I started making dal in the pressure cooker - probably before my current students were born.  Switching from the regular pressure cooker to the Instant Pot has made an easy recipe even easier.  The butter and cream are optional here, but they make it delicions.  You can also omit the tomatoes if you wish._

Rinse and drain the lentils and kidney beans.  Pulse the tomatoes with an emersion blender.

Put the lentils, kidney beans, ginger, and garlic into the instant pot and cover with about one quart of water.  Cook on high pressure for 12 minutes.  Release the pressure manually, and then set the Instant Pot to the highest slow cook setting.
 
Add the spices.  Pulse the tomatoes with an emersion blender, and add those as well.  Drop the stick of butter into the pot, and the cream if you are using it (if you are using cream, you can reduce the butter).  Leave the Instant Pot on the slow cook setting for at least 30 minutes before serving (you can leave it on slow cook for hours if you want).
